# Edson Figueroa's Portfolio

My name is Edson Figueroa and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and I am a computer science major. I expect to graduate in 2028.

## My Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

* Lab 2

  In this lab, we had to use code to make a mad lib. We would have to be able to allow people to put their input in the terminal and store it in a string and call it to be able to fill it in with the paragraph. I thought it was fun because I like mad libs so I got to see the words I typed in come into the screen and complete the sentences.


* Lab 3

 For part 1 of this lab, we had to make a Basal Metabolic Rate Calculator. We would input numbers that would be stored in variables that correspond to a personâ€™s height, weight, and age. Then, we would put those variables in an equation to find the Basal Metabolic Rate of a person. I liked it because it is a useful tool for people who want to know this information about themselves. Part 2 was similar, but we were calculating Julian Days. It would represent the number of days since day zero depending on what day we input. 

* Lab 10

  For lab 10, we were making a file that would show the population of California based on their counties. I think this one was really tricky for me because of the if and for statements along with operators because I would confuse what some of them would do. I liked this lab because we got to pull already existing data and try to output that on the screen. It was different from just inputting something and just getting the result.
